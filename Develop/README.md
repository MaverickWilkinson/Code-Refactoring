# Code Refactor

## Summary
The goal of this assignment was to take the code for a website and refactor it to make improvements. Before making changes, there were many functionality errors and there was virtually no way for a mobile user to view the website comfortably.

## What I changed
* Added a missing id tag to a class that was required for the navigation links to be usable
* Changed the formatting of the link to the large background image to be consistent with the other methods of linking for convenience and made the image function better as screen size changes
* Improved naming scheme for a couple classes to make the intention of the classes easier to read
* Changed the programming of the main content boxes to allow the height to change reletively for mobile use
* Changed the programming of the side bar to stretch accross the whole screen and go below the main content once the size limit of the screen became too small to hold the sidebar and the boxes on the same level
* Changed how the navigation buttons are displayed such that they remain contained in the header element
